# Methotrexate-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of methotrexate as substrate of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transport protein and the victim drug for Drug-Drug-Interaction (DDI) simulations.

The presented PBPK model of methotrexate has been developed to be used in a PBPK Drug-Drug-Interactions (DDI) network with methotrexate as victim drug of BCRP. The development of this model is described in the publication by Schaller *et al.* [[1](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Methotrexate-Model?tab=readme-ov-file#references)]

## Repository files

- a PK-Sim project file of the current PBPK model
- a PK-Sim snapshot (*.json) file of the current PBPK model

## Version information

PK-Sim Version 9.1
